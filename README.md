# Swiper Package

## About This Project
This is a collaborative assignment by **Callum** and **Aren** where we researched and presented the Swiper npm package to our class. We explored its capabilities by implementing three different swiper types with fully responsive designs using React Router.

## Our Implementation

We created three interactive examples showcasing different Swiper effects, all integrated on a single page using **React Router** for easy navigation between demonstrations.

### Example 1: Slide Effect
The classic sliding animation that smoothly transitions between slides. Perfect for:
- Image galleries
- Product showcases
- Testimonials
- Content carousels

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Responsive breakpoints
- Navigation arrows
- Pagination dots
- Autoplay functionality
- Loop mode

### Example 2: Cube Effect
A stunning 3D cube rotation that creates an immersive visual experience. Ideal for:
- Portfolio presentations
- Feature highlights
- Creative storytelling

**Key Features Implemented:**
- 3D perspective animations
- Shadow effects
- Responsive cube sizing
- Touch/swipe controls

### Example 3: Flip Effect
A dynamic flip card animation that reveals content with style. Best suited for:
- Card-based layouts
- Information reveals
- Interactive presentations
- Modern UI designs
- Before/after comparisons

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Smooth 3D transitions
- Mobile-optimized flipping
- Custom timing controls
- Responsive card dimensions

## Key Features We Explored

- ✅ **Fully Responsive** - Works on all screen sizes
- ✅ **Touch Support** - Native mobile gestures
- ✅ **Multiple Effect Options** - 6 different transition types
- ✅ **Navigation** - Arrows, pagination, scrollbar options
- ✅ **Autoplay** - Configurable automatic sliding
- ✅ **Lazy Loading** - Optimize image loading
- ✅ **Keyboard Control** - Navigate with arrow keys
- ✅ **Loop Mode** - Infinite sliding
- ✅ **Accessibility** - ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Project Structure

We organized our project using React Router to create a seamless navigation experience between different Swiper examples:

/               → Homepage with navigation links
/slide          → Slide effect demonstration
/cube           → Cube effect demonstration
/flip           → Flip effect demonstration


## What We Learned

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with:
- Advanced React component integration
- 3D CSS transformations and animations
- Responsive design principles
- Touch and gesture handling
- Modern carousel implementation
- Collaborative development using Trello for task management
